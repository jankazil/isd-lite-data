# ISD-lite-data

**ISD-lite-data** is a Python toolkit for accessing, downloading, and processing [ISDLite](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-lite) data. ISDLite is a version of the Integrated Surface Database (ISD), provided online by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).

ISDLite is a product derived from [ISD](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database), which is easier to work with for general research and scientific purposes. It is a subset of the full ISD containing eight common surface parameters in a fixed-width format free of duplicate values, sub-hourly data, and complicated flags.

## Overview

The project consists of the following modules:

- **`ncei.py`**  
  Functions for:
  - Downloading ISDLite data (unless present as local files).

- **`data.py`**  
  Classes and functions for:
  - Loading ISD station metadata from the web
  - Loading ISD station metadata from file
  - Saving ISD station metadata to a file
  - Listing available countries and US states.
  - Filtering stations by
    - country
    - US state
    - geographic bounding box (latitude and longitude)
    - time period for which a station has observations (nominally)
    - time period for which a station has observations (actually available for download)
  - Listing all or select metadata of select stations:
    - station USAF and WBAN ID
    - station name
    - station coordinates
    - station elevation
    - station period with obervations

## Dependencies

- Python â‰¥ 3.10
- Required Python packages:
  - `requests`
  - `pandas`

## Usage

All test scripts demonstrate usage and serve as functional examples. See:

- `test_ncei_download.py`  
  Download a sample ISD Lite file for a given year and station.
- `test_ncei_download_year_range.py`  
  Download ISD Lite files for a given range of years for a given station.

- `test_data_stations.py`  
  Initialize the station metadata database and print all available country and US state codes.

- `test_data_stations_filter_by_country.py`  
  Filter the station metadata by country code (e.g., 'CH' for Switzerland/China), then further by geographic coordinates.

- `test_data_stations_filter_by_US_state.py`  
  Filter the station metadata by US state code (e.g., 'CO' for Colorado).

- `test_data_stations_metadata.py`  
  Filter the station metadata by country code (e.g., 'CH' for Switzerland/China), then further by geographic coordinates and period of interest; list selected station metadata (station name, coordinates, elevation).

## Notes

- Download operations are read-only and anonymous; no credentials are required.
- Country codes in the ISD metadata are not always unambiguous. For example, the code `'CH'` is used for both Switzerland and China. Use the geographic filtering methods to disambiguate as needed.
