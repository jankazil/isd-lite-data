# ISD-lite-data

**ISD-lite-data** is a Python toolkit for accessing, downloading, and processing [ISDLite](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-lite) data. ISDLite is a version of the Integrated Surface Database (ISD), provided online by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).

ISDLite is a product derived from [ISD](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database), which is easier to work with for general research and scientific purposes. It is a subset of the full ISD containing eight common surface parameters in a fixed-width format free of duplicate values, sub-hourly data, and complicated flags.

## Overview

The project consists of the following modules:

- **`ncei.py`**  
  Functions for:
  - Downloading ISD station metadata (`isd-history.txt`)
  - Downloading ISDLite data files
  - Downloading multiple ISDLite data files in parallel using threading

- **`data.py`**  
  Classes and functions for:
  - Loading ISD station metadata from the web or local file
  - Saving ISD station metadata to file
  - Listing available countries and US states
  - Filtering stations by:
    - country
    - US state
    - geographic bounding box (latitude and longitude)
    - time period for which a station has observations (nominally)
    - time period for which a station has observations (actually available for download)
  - Listing selected station metadata:
    - station USAF and WBAN ID
    - station name
    - station coordinates
    - station elevation
    - period with observations

## Dependencies

- Python â‰¥ 3.10
- Required Python packages:
  - `requests`
  - `pandas`

## Usage

All test scripts demonstrate usage and serve as functional examples. See:

- `test_ncei_download_stations.py`  
  Download the ISD station metadata file (`isd-history.txt`) and save it locally.

- `test_data_stations.py`  
  Initialize the station metadata database and print all available country and US state codes.

- `test_data_stations_filter_by_country.py`  
  Filter station metadata by country code (e.g., 'CH' for Switzerland/China), then further by geographic coordinates.

- `test_data_stations_filter_by_US_state.py`  
  Filter station metadata by US state code (e.g., 'CO' for Colorado).

- `test_data_stations_metadata.py`  
  Filter station metadata by country, geographic bounding box, and time period. Print selected station metadata.

- `test_ncei_download.py`  
  Download a sample ISDLite data file for a given year and station.

- `test_ncei_download_year_range.py`  
  Download ISDLite data files for a given range of years for a given list of stations.

### Regional Downloads - Contiguous United States (CONUS)

- `scripts/Download_CONUS_Stations_Metadata.py`  
  Download the ISD station metadata file and produce:
  - `conus_stations.txt`: a list of stations located in the contiguous US (CONUS)
  - `CONUS.2020-12-03 00:00:00-2025-07-31 00:00:00.txt`: a list of CONUS stations with observations between 2020-12-03 and 2025-07-31

- `scripts/Download_CONUS_Stations_Observations.py`  
  Read the list of CONUS stations with data in the period 2020-12-03 to 2025-07-31 and download the corresponding ISDLite data files.

## Notes

- Download operations are read-only and anonymous; no credentials are required.
- Country codes in the ISD metadata are not always unambiguous. For example, `'CH'` is used for both Switzerland and China. Use geographic filtering to disambiguate.
- The CONUS scripts demonstrate a practical pipeline for extracting and downloading regional observational datasets using ISDLite.
