# ISD-lite-data

**ISD-lite-data** is a Python toolkit for accessing, downloading, and processing [ISDLite](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-lite) data. ISDLite is a version of the Integrated Surface Database (ISD), provided online by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).

ISDLite is product derived from [ISD](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database), which is easier to work with for general research and scientific purposes. It is a subset of the full ISD containing eight common surface parameters in a fixed-width format free of duplicate values, sub-hourly data, and complicated flags.

## Overview

The project consists of the following modules:

- **`ncei.py`**: Functions for
  - Downloading ISDLite data

## Dependencies

- Python â‰¥ 3.10
- Required Python packages:
  - `requests`

## Usage

All test scripts demonstrate usage and serve as functional examples. See:

- `test_ncei_download.py` for downloading a sample ISD Lite file for a given year and station 
- `test_ncei_download_year_range.py` for downloading ISD Lite files for a given range of years, for a given station 

## Notes

- Download operations are read-only and anonymous; no credentials are required.
