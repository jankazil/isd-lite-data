# ISD-lite-data

**ISD-lite-data** is a Python toolkit for accessing, downloading, and processing [ISDLite](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-lite/) version data of the [Integrated Surface Database (ISD)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database) from NOAA.

ISDLite is product derived from ISD that makes it easier to work with for general research and scientific purposes. It is a subset of the full ISD containing eight common surface parameters in a fixed-width format free of duplicate values, sub-hourly data, and complicated flags.[^1]

The project consists of two main modules:

- **`ncei.py`**: Functions for
  - Downloading ISDLite data

## Dependencies
