# ISD-lite-data

**ISD-lite-data** is a Python toolkit for accessing, downloading, and processing [ISDLite](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-lite) data. ISDLite is a version of the Integrated Surface Database (ISD), provided online by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).

ISDLite is a product derived from [ISD](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database), which is easier to work with for general research and scientific purposes. It is a subset of the full ISD containing eight common surface parameters in a fixed-width format free of duplicate values, sub-hourly data, and complicated flags.

## Overview

The project consists of the following modules:

- **`ncei`**  
  Functions for:
  - Downloading ISDLite station metadata (`isd-history.txt`)
  - Downloading ISDLite data files
  - Downloading multiple ISDLite data files in parallel using threading

- **`stations`**  
  Classes and functions for:
  - Loading ISDLite station metadata from the web or local file
  - Saving ISDLite station metadata to file
  - Listing available countries and US states
  - Filtering stations by:
    - country
    - US state
    - geographic bounding box (latitude and longitude)
    - time period for which a station has observations (nominally)
    - time period for which a station has observations (actually available for download)
  - Listing selected station metadata:
    - station USAF and WBAN ID
    - station name
    - station coordinates
    - station elevation
    - period with observations
  - Loading station observations from ISDLite data files
  - Saving station observations and station metadata as a netCDF file
  - Reading station observations and station metadata from a netCDF file

## Public API

The list of modules, classes, and functions is documented in [public-api.md](docs/public-api.md).

## Dependencies

- Python â‰¥ 3.10
- Required Python packages:
  - `requests`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `xarray`

## Usage

All test scripts demonstrate usage and serve as functional examples. See:

- `test_ncei_download_stations.py`  
  Download the ISDLite station metadata file (`isd-history.txt`) and save it locally.

- `test_data_stations.py`  
  Initialize the station metadata database and print all available country and US state codes.

- `test_data_stations_filter_by_country.py`  
  Filter station metadata by country code (e.g., 'CH' for Switzerland/China), then further by geographic coordinates.

- `test_data_stations_filter_by_US_state.py`  
  Filter station metadata by US state code (e.g., 'CO' for Colorado).

- `test_data_stations_metadata.py`  
  Filter station metadata by country, geographic bounding box, and time period. Print selected station metadata.

- `test_ncei_download.py`  
  Download a sample ISDLite data file for a given year and station.

- `test_ncei_download_year_range.py`  
  Download ISDLite data files for a given range of years for a given list of stations.

### Regional Downloads - Switzerland

Scripts are intended to be executed in the following sequence:

- `scripts/Switzerland_Metadata_Download.py`  
  Download the ISDLite station metadata file and produce:
  - `data/switzerland_stations.2020-2023.txt`:  
     station metadata of Swiss stations for which observations are available for download between 2020-12-03 and 2023-12-31.
- `scripts/Switzerland_Observations_Download.py`  
  Download the ISDLite station observations and produce:
  - `data/USAF_ID-WBAN_ID-YYYY.gz`:  
     files with observations of Swiss stations for which observations are available for download between 2020-12-03 and 2023-12-31. 
- `scripts/Switzerland_Observations_Load.py`  
  Load the ISDLite station observationsand produce:
  - `data/switzerland_stations.2020-2023.nc`:  
     netCDF file with observations of Swiss stations for which observations are available for download between 2020-12-03 and 2023-12-31. 
- `scripts/Switzerland_Observations_Load_netCDF.py`  
  Load the ISDLite Swiss station observations from the netCDF file `data/switzerland_stations.2020-2023.nc`

### Regional Downloads - Contiguous United States (CONUS)

Scripts are intended to be executed in the following sequence:

- `scripts/CONUS_Metadata_Download.py`  
  Download the ISDLite station metadata file and produce:
  - `data/conus_stations.2020-2025.txt`:  
     station metadata of CONUS stations for which observations are available for download between 2020-12-03 and 2025-07-31.
- `scripts/CONUS_Observations_Download.py`  
  Download the ISDLite station observations and produce:
  - `data/USAF_ID-WBAN_ID-YYYY.gz`:  
     files with observations at CONUS stations for which observations are available for download between 2020-12-03 and 2025-07-31. 
- `scripts/CONUS_Observations_Load.py`  
  Load the ISDLite station observations and produce:
  - `data/conus_stations.2020-2025.nc`:  
     netCDF file with observations at CONUS stations for which observations are available for download between 2020-12-03 and 2025-07-31.
- `scripts/CONUS_Observations_Load_netCDF.py`  
  Load the ISDLite CONUS station observations the netCDF file `data/conus_stations.2020-2025.nc`

## Notes

- Download operations are read-only and anonymous; no credentials are required.
- Download operations can be parallelized for speed with a user-specified number > 1 of concurrent download requests.
- Download operations will check if local ISDLite metadata files and observation files are present; if they are and their ETag matches their ETag online, they will not be downloaded, unless instructed with refresh = True.
- Loading of thousands of observation data files from disk can be slow.
- Country codes in the ISDLite metadata are not always unambiguous. For example, `'CH'` is used for both Switzerland and China. Use geographic filtering to disambiguate.
- The CONUS and Switzerland scripts demonstrate a practical pipeline for identifiying, downloading, loading to memory, and saving as netCDF files regional ISDLite observation data. The Switzerland contain fewer stations than the CONUS scripts and are therefore faster.
